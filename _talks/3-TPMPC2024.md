<summary>Abstract</summary>
In this two-parts talk we will introduce the "distributed discrete logarithm" problem (DDLog) and present many of the exciting applications it has enabled in recent years. DDLog is a crucial tool in recent share-conversion protocols and has enabled many exciting such as MPC with sub-linear complexity, homomorphic- and function secret-sharing, pseudorandom correlation generators, garbling, and more. We will give examples of DDLog protocol from established assumptions, and dive into some of the applications.
